# 需求1
```text
1. Users (User) and Administrators (Admin) can register and log in to the system.
````
    注册功能
        register #{type} #{userName} #{pw}
        管理员注册成功Admin #{userName} successfully registered.
        普通用户注册成功User #{userName} successfully registered.
        注册失败：需求未明确，暂定为："Register failed"
    登录功能
        login #{userName} #{pw}
        管理员登录成功：Admin #{userName} successfully logged in.
        普通用户登录成功：User #{userName} successfully logged in.
        登录失败：需求未明确，暂定为："Login failed".
        bug: 注册需要指定用户类型，但是登录却没有指定，这样会发生重名的不同用户类型的情况，默认所有用户类型都必须用户名唯一，不能重名

# 需求2
```text
#2. Users can view the list of books, borrow multiple books, and return these books.
```

    查看列表：
        search #{bookName} #{writer}
        
            Book List:
            #{bookName} - #{writer} - Inventory: #{stock}
    借书功能：
        borrow #{bookName} #{writer}
        借书成功：Book #{bookName} successfully borrowed.
        借书失败：需求未明确，暂定：Sorry, book #{bookName} is not available
    还书功能：
        return #{bookName} #{writer}
        还书成功：Book #{bookName} successfully returned.
        还书失败：需求不明确，暂定还书必须规定此书在该用户名下。Sorry, book #{bookName} cannot be returned by user #{userName}

# 需求3
```text
#3. Administrators have the authority to view the list of books, add books, delete 
books. If a book is already in the system and the administrator tries to add it 
again, the system should merge the inventory rather than create a new one. Also, 
administrators cannot delete books that are currently being borrowed by users.
```

    查看列表：
        search #{bookName} #{writer}
    添加图书：
        add #{bookName} #{writer} #{count}
        第一次添加成功：Book #{bookName} by #{writer} added successfully, inventory: #{stock}.
        第二次添加成功：Book #{bookName} inventory successfully updated, new inventory: #{stock}.
    删除图书：
        delete #{bookName} #{writer}
        删除失败：Cannot delete book #{bookName} because it is currently borrowed.
        删除成功：Book #{bookName} by #{writer} deleted successfully.
